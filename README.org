#+TITLE: Endless Stream
#+SUBTITLE: Multiplayer Dungeon Crawling

Endless Stream is a 2D rougelike turn-based dungeon crawling role-playing
game. Create a character, pick a world, join a party and go kill stuff in
dungeons! How dangerous could it be?

This repository contains all the back-end code for the Endless Stream game.

It also contains the GRPC protobuf schema files, as well as the generated code
for Go, C#, JavaScript, and TypeScript. Additionally, it packages the C#
generated code into a NuGet package.
